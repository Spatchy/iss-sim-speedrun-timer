# iss-sim-speedrun-timer
A neat speedrun timer for SpaceX's ISS Docking Simulator! Compete with others for the fastest successful docking.

Simply install the extension and press the 'Begin' button on [iss-sim.spacex.com](https://iss-sim.spacex.com/). The timer will be added to the HUD on the right. The timer will begin as soon as you gain control of the capsule and will end as soon as you make contact with the ISS.

### Installation
The project is now available on the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iss-sim-speedrun-timer/necjicdkncboglcmpmhgeghdiplfjbik)!

### Thanks!
Quick edit 2022: I had no idea so many people actually used this, thanks to the 240 users!
